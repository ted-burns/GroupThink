This application was developed as the final project for my Introduction to iOS Development class at Boston College, taught by Professor Gallaugher. 

It uses Spotify's web API to search and retrieve song data, as well as to get recommendations for similar songs that you might like.

NOTE: You need a Spotify account in order to access the application
